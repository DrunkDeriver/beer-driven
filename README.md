A repository for learning... and :beer:

## Purpose
This repository was created to share my ongoing learning - and drinking - experience with others. It is primarily for example programs created in a setting where I am learning or teaching, but could also hold:
- Notes
- Links to References
- Teaching materials such as slide decks, practice problems, and other small files
- Subjects that are completely NOT programming-related. 

## Organization
There should not be much going on in the root directory, besides this readme, the LICENSE, and subject directories. 

Subjects covered will use the following structure:
* SUBJECT
	* notes
	* prog
	* ref
	* wb
	* README.md

#### SUBJECT
SUBJECT is a placeholder for the name of any particular topic. Since this is a a repo, I will shorten the names a bit. It is a directory in this repo.

#### README.md
Think of this as a syllabus. It will state the subject more explicitly than the directory name inside. I am using the name this name mostly for GitHub compatability, but also as a reminder to RTFM. 

#### notes
The notes directory is for notes. Filenames should be concise in regard to the topic they cover.

#### prog
The prog directory is for progs, or "programs." Get with the times.

#### ref
The ref directory is for references. These will normally be files containing links.

#### wb
This is the workbook. It holds other instructional materials related to the topic.
