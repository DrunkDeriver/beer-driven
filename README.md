A repository for learning... and drinking.

## Purpose
This repository was created to share my ongoing learning - and drinking - experience with others. It is primarily for example programs created in a setting where I am learning or teaching, but could also hold:
- Notes
- Links to References
- Teaching materials such as slide decks, practice problems, and other small files

## Organization
As a general rule, the repo will use the following structure:
SUBJECT
  \|--notes
  \|--prog
  \|--ref
  \|--wb
  \|--SUBJECT.md

#### SUBJECT
SUBJECT is a placeholder for the name of any particular topic.

#### notes
The notes directory is for notes. Filenames should be concise in regard to the topic they cover.

#### prog
The prog directory is for progs, or "programs." Get with the times.

#### ref
The ref directory is for references. These will normally be files containing links.

#### wb
This is the workbook. It holds instructional materials related to the topic.
